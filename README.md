### Using Scikit-learn to implement simple DecisionTreeClassifier
**Scikit-learn** is a library that contributes to development of a variety machine learning models.This models solve Regression or Classification problems.Today we will be implementing a simple decision tree model to classify iris plants into three species using the lengths and widths of their petals and sepals, a classic data set in the machine learning community.
The iris samples in question fall into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
